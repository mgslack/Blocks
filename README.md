# Blocks
Blocks is a simple Tetris clone, spiritually based on a Turbo Pascal conversion done of the
Son-of-Tetris project back in 1990.  This rewrite is mainly based on the Java version
created back in 2002 using modified versions of the TetrisBean components created by
Scott Clee for IBM DevelopersWorks.

Game is dependent on GameStatistics library and is needed if re-compiling game. Last updated/compiled
using VS 2019.

For grins and giggles, added the original rewrite of the SOT into TP.  Can use DosBox to run.
