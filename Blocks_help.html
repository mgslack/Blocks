    <p>Blocks is a Tetris clone game.  Originally based off of the Son-Of-Tetris project, converted to
	   Turbo Pascal in 1990.  Later rewrote in Java using a modification of the TetrisBean component
	   created by Scott Clee for IBM DeveloperWorks in 2002.  Rewrote again into C#, spiritually
	   based on the orginal TP conversion, but mainly using the Java version in the rewrite.</p>
    <p>Blocks is controllable using either the keyboard (keypad) or the mouse.  Can start/stop the game,
	   pause it or move the current active piece left, right, rotate or drop.  Numlock can be off or
	   on for the left, right or down keys to operate the movement if using the keyboard.  The center ('5')
	   key will rotate the piece.  In addition to the down key dropping the current piece, can use the
	   space bar to drop the piece.  The esc key can be used to pause/un-pause the game.</p>
	<p>If viewing the help, about box or game statistics dialog, the game will self-pause until the
	   user un-pauses the game and continues play.  The stop button will stop a game at anytime and the
	   current game will be over.</p>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <p>There are no real options to set or configure for the game of Blocks.  The game does save off
	   the main window position when exiting the program.</p>
